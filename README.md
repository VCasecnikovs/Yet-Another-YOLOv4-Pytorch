!!! For the jupyter notebook please install pytorch-lightning version 0.7.6

This is implementation of YOLOv4 object detection neural network on pytorch. I'll try to implement all features of original paper.

 - [x] Letterbox for validation
 - [x] HSV transforms for train
 - [x] MOSAIC for train
 - [x] Dropblock layers for training. One in each PAN layer, but you can easily add it to each layer. (Thanks to Evgenii Zheltonozhskii for pytorch implementation)
 - [x] LARS optimizer

## What you can already do
You can use video_demo.py to take a look at the original weights realtime OD detection. (Have 9 fps on my GTX1060 laptop!!!)
![](/github_imgs/realtime.jpg)

You can train your own model with mosaic augmentation for training. Guides how to do this are written below. Borders of images on some datasets are even hard to find.
![](/github_imgs/mosaic.png)


You can make inference, guide bellow.


## Initialize NN

    #YOU CAN USE TORCH HUB
    m = torch.hub.load("VCasecnikovs/Yet-Another-YOLOv4-Pytorch", "yolov4", pretrained=True)

    import model
    #If you change n_classes from the pretrained, there will be caught one error, don't panic it is ok

    #FROM SAVED WEIGHTS
    m = model.YOLOv4(n_classes=1, weights_path="weights/yolov4.pth")

    #AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD PRETRAINED
    m = model.YOLOv4(n_classes=1, pretrained=True)

## Download weights
You can use torch hub
or you can download weights using from this link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=12AaR4fvIQPZ468vhm0ZYZSLgWac2HBnq

## Initialize dataset

    import dataset
    d = dataset.ListDataset("train.txt", img_dir='images', labels_dir='labels', img_extensions=['.JPG'], train=True)
	path, img, bboxes = d[0]

!!! You can use SplitDataset.ipynb to create train.txt and valid.txt

"train.txt" is file which consists with filepaths to image (images\primula\DSC02542.JPG)

img_dir - Folder with images
labels_dir - Folder with txt files for annotation
img_extensions - extensions if images

If you set train=False -> uses letterboxes
If you set train=True -> HSV augmentations and mosaic

dataset has collate_function

    # collate func example
    y1 = d[0]
    y2 = d[1]
    paths_b, xb, yb = d.collate_fn((y1, y2))
	# yb has 6 columns
	
## Y's format
Is a tensor of size (B, 6), where B is amount of boxes in all batch images.
 1. Index of img to which this anchor belongs (if 1, then it belongs to x[1])
 2. BBox class
 3. x center
 4. y center
 5. width
 6. height

## Forward with loss
    y_hat, loss = m(xb, yb)

!!! y_hat is already resized anchors to image size bboxes

## Forward without loss
    y_hat,  _ = m(img_batch) #_ is (0, 0, 0)

## Check if bboxes are correct
    import utils
    from PIL import Image
    path, img, bboxes = d[0]
    img_with_bboxes = utils.get_img_with_bboxes(img, bboxes[:, 2:]) #Returns numpy array
    Image.fromarray(img_with_bboxes)
    
## Get predicted bboxes
    anchors, loss = m(xb.cuda(), yb.cuda())
    confidence_threshold = 0.05
    iou_threshold = 0.5
    bboxes, labels = utils.get_bboxes_from_anchors(anchors, confidence_threshold, iou_threshold, coco_dict) #COCO dict is id->class dictionary (f.e. 0->person)
    #For first img
    arr = utils.get_img_with_bboxes(xb[0].cpu(), bboxes[0].cpu(), resize=False, labels=labels[0])
    Image.fromarray(arr)
